      <h2>The Problem</h2>
      <p>
        Beneath the flashy homepages of your favorite sites lurk Hooli™ and
        other evil corporations out to hoard and sell your most personal data.
      </p>
      <p>
        What was built to be the ultimate platform for the free sharing of
        knowledge has turned into a money-hungry monster feasting on our privacy
        and freedom.
      </p>
      <p>
        But fear not, for Pied Piper has the answer! And it’s simple: An
        autonomous peer-to-peer network featuring distributed storage powered by
        universal compression, accelerated scheduling allocation, and end-to-end
        encryption.
      </p>
      <p>
        Put even simpler — <b>it’s the internet, completely decentralized.</b>
